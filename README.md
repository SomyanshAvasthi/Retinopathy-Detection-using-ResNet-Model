# Problem Statement
To develop a computer aided diagnosis tool to detect the presence of diabetic  retinopathy and classify whether it is a normal diabetic retinopathy or an abnormal  diabetic retinopathy.

#Introduction
Diabetic Retinopathy is a condition that may occur in people who have diabetes. It causes progressive damage to the retina, the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye. Diabetic retinopathy is a serious sight-threatening complication of diabetes. Diabetes interferes with the body's ability to use and store sugar (glucose). The disease is characterized by too much sugar in the blood, which can cause damage throughout the body, including the eyes. Over time, diabetes damages small blood vessels throughout the body, including the retina Diabetic retinopathy occurs when these tiny blood vessels leak blood and other fluids. This causes the retinal tissue to swell, resulting in cloudy or blurred vision.

Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely they will develop diabetic retinopathy. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness when people with diabetes experience long periods of high blood sugar, fluid can accumulate in the lens inside the eye trat controls focusing. This changes the curvature of the lens, leading to changes in vision. However, once blood sugar levels are controlled, usually the lens will return to its original shape and vision improves. Patients with diabetes who can better control their blood sugar levels will slow the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy.

According to a 2018 American Eye-Q survey conducted by the AOA, nearly half of Americans didn't know whether diabetic eye diseases have visible symptoms (often which the early stages of diabetic retinopathy do not). The same survey found that more than one-third of Americans didn't know a comprehensive eye exam is the only way to determine if a person's diabetes will cause blindness, so the ADA recommends that everyone with diabetes have a comprehensive dilated eye examination at least once a year. Early detection and treatment can limit the potential for significant vision loss from diabetic retinopathy.

# Conclusion
In this project, able to classify the images into different stages of DR using the pretrained RESNET model. The GUI we developed will be helpful for both doctors and also the common people.
